## Database Diagram

if needed

### Planning

![image](static/images/readme/database.png)


#### Model 1
  - This is the main model for the website to function. I based this off the walkthrough I think therefore I blog. Adjusted the layout a bit to fit the website function as a worldwide sharing platform for recipes in mind.

#### Model 2
 - The comment model allows logged in users to comment on recipes.

#### Model 3
  - The custom model.
  - Enable users to like recipes.

## User Experience

user experience writeup goes here

### Agile

I employed the agile methodology, starting from the planning stage and continuing until the final product was built. To ensure that I stayed organized and on track, I utilized a GitHub project and a [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/adrianskelton/projects/5/views/1). Information about User Stories can be found in the subsection below⇩ 

**Five planes of User Experience:**

### Strategy

My User Stories can be found [here](https://github.com/adrianskelton/adrianproject4/issues). All User Stories include:
 - Acceptance Criteria
 - Tasks
 - Labels (MoSCoW Priotarization)

Some of the User Stories are part of an EPIC.

Please, go to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) if you want to come to the section where I test my User Stories.

#### Key Project Goal

The key goal of the website is to create a platform where users can create an account and share recipes as well as viewing recipes shared by other users.

#### Target Audience

The target audience is primarily people who have family recipes that they are proud of and want to share with the world but also anyone that likes to cook and who wants new and different recipes to try out from around the world. That is why I added country as an option to the recipe model as well as the like function so that users could see how the recipes were rated.

#### User Requirements and Expectations:

- Easy navigation throughout the site.

- another one

- another one

- another one

- another one


### Scope

#### Content | Functionality Requirements:

- Easily accessible navigation bar with the links that have easily understandable names.

- Responsive design.

- A brief and simple description of the site’s purpose.

- A complete collection of recipes.

- A thorough list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions to follow.

- A possibility to see what country the recipe is from.

- A possibility to read comments.

#### Authentication:

- Add registration/login features that give the user access to extra functionality.

- Add Logout functionality for security reasons.

#### Functionality for logged-in users:

  - **CRUD functionality:**

    - Implement feature that allows user to **C**reate recipes.
    - Implement feature that allows user to **R**ead recipes.
    - Implement feature that allows user to **U**pdate recipes.
    - Implement feature that allows user to **D**elete recipes.

  - **Comment and like feature:**

    - Enable logged-in users to post comments on any of the published recipes.
    - Enable logged-in users to like/unlike published recipes.


### Structure

The blog is divided into different pages. Some of the pages are accessible only for logged in users. The blog structure allows users to access recipes via the recipes page or by sorting them through different categories. All users can access detailed information about each recipe by clicking on the recipe card. Users who are logged in can publish, edit, and delete their own recipes, and interact with other recipes by liking and commenting on them.

**For detailed information about all existing features see the section [Existing Features](#existing-features).**


### Skeleton

I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Please note this was only a concept in the beginning so the end result was quite different.

<details>
<summary>Home page</summary>

All users

### Surface

#### Colour Scheme

The choice of colors depends on the background image chosen for home, sign up, login, and logout pages.

![image](static/images/readme/palette.png)

 - **`313131`** is the primary color used throughout the pages:
   - Welcome message.
   - Category boxes on the home page.
   - Add | Edit recipe forms.
   - Sign Up | Login | Logout forms.
   - Confirmation message when choosing to delete a recipe.

 - **`850000`** is used for links and hover styling on navbar and footer. The color was chosen with the help of [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.7/color-contrast) (provided by Lighthouse testing) in order for background and foreground colors to have a sufficient contrast ratio.

 - **`FFFFFF`** is used as the background color for all recipe-related pages including recipes, recipe details, add recipe, edit recipe and categories.

#### Button styling

All buttons throughout the pages have the same styling, ensuring uniformity and providing a seamless user experience. 
 
I went with following colors:
  - `GREEN` that usually is associated with "YES" | "SAVE" | "OK".
  - `#7e180d` that usually is associated with "NO" | "CANCEL" | "GO BACK".
  - `WHITE` for the text in order to get a sufficient contrast ratio.

    ![image]()

#### Recipe images:

Users have the option to upload images in various sizes. To ensure consistency, I made sure that all recipe cards on the same line had the same height. The size of the images doesn't affect the layout of the recipe detail page. All sections are uploaded correctly as they should be.

![image](static/images/readme/palette.png)

- The colors used were based on the the colors in the logo and the hero image tomato color that stood out to me. I chose the primary color to invoke a feeling of warmth of sharing recipes with community and it matched the heart color as part of the logo. 
  - #7E180D color1
  - #FFFFFF color2 
  - #313131 color3

#### Typography

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the chosen fonts in use for the site.


- I have used **"Josefin"** for all the headings.

  ![image](static/images/readme/font-josefin.png)

- For the paragraphs I went with **"Crimson"**

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navigation Bar

- The navbar is bootstrap and is at the top right of every page. 
- If the user is logged in or is a guest the menu content changes appropriately. 
- The hamburger menu is applied on media breakpoint of 979px. This was when the text from the navbar started going into the family recipe logo and looked cluttered.
- I kept the menu clean with no additional styling to focus attention on the recipes and content instead.
 
  - **Guests:**

    ![image](static/images/readme/desktop-navbar-guest.png)
    
    - The navigation bar contains links for the Logo, Home, Register and Login pages.
    - Clicking "Register" directs users to the create account form.
    - Clicking "Login" directs users to the login form.

  - **Logged-in users:**
    
    ![image](static/images/readme/navbar-desktop.png)

    - The navigation bar contains links for the Logo, Home, Recipes, Add Recipe, and Logout pages.
    - Clicking "Add Recipe" takes the user to a page where they can fill in a form to publish a recipe.
    - Clicking "Logout" directs users to the confirmation page.

- On smaller devices, the navigation bar is displayed using a hamburger menu:

#### Welcome message

- This section welcomes users to the blog, once the user is logged in this message changes, this was achieved using the django check to see if the user is authenticated. 

The short welcome explains:
  - The concept of the site as a platform to share recipes.
  - That the user will need to create an account to do this.

![image](static/images/readme/welcome-guest.png)

The message then changes as seen below. I put a link after the welcome to the user to allow them to view their recipes. From this page they are also able to comment, like, edit and delete their recipes.

![image](static/images/readme/welcome-logged-in.png)

  ````
  import os
  import dj_database_url
  if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
      import env
  ````

- Remove the insecure secret key provided by Django. Change your SECRET_KEY variable to the following: `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`

    STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ````
 
### Tell Django where templates will be stored

  - Link file to the templates directory in Heroku. _Place under the BASE_DIR line_:

    `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`

  - Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR:

    ````
    TEMPLATES = [
    {
      ...,
      'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
      ...,
          ],
        },
      },
    ]
    ````
